# CAPS
Created by Bryce Pfingston  

## Installation  
npm i { jest, supertest, faker}  
  
## Summary of Problem Domain  
Begin the build of an application for a company called CAPS - The Code Academy Parcel Service. In this sprint, weâ€™ll build out a system that emulates a real world supply chain. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such a flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, be notified that their customers received what they purchased.
